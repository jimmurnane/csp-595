## How to build and deploy the project
1) Use Git to clone my repo into any one of your own directories on your computer. Here is the URL you use to perform the clone,(https://github.com/philippannenko/csp-595.git).
2) In cmd, navigate to the {project}\bat directory and run the bat file that configures your env. (you may need to update this file to represent your directories. all of the env must be set)
3) Navigate to {project}\ant directory (in the same cmd prompt!)
4) Type the following command into cmd without the single quotes: 'ant'
5) The project should compile and then deploy the necessary file to you tomcat directory for your viewing pleasures, (http://localhost/csp-595)
